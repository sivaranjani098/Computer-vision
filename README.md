# Computer-vision

  Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It uses digital images and videos from cameras, along with deep learning models, to help machines identify and classify objects, and then react to what they "see"
# Applications of computer vision 
  Computer vision has a wide range of practical applications including Object Detection ,Recognition,Image Classification, Video Analysis, Surgical Assistance,Patient Monitoring,Lane Detection.
# Libraries
  There are numerous computer vision libraries available such as OpenCV,TensorFlow,PyTorch,Scikit-image.
# Face detection 
  To find human faces within larger images and distinguish them from nonface objects such as landscapes, buildings and other human body parts. Before face detection begins, the analyzed media is preprocessed to improve its quality and remove images that might interfere with detection.
Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes, one of the easiest features to detect. They then try to detect facial landmarks, such as eyebrows, mouth, nose, nostrils and irises. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found a facial region, it does additional tests to confirm that it has detected a face.
